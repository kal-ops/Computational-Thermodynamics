# Computational-Thermodynamics
Here is the code for a matplotlib 3D plot of A3 transformation temperatures of 0.2 mass % carbon steel with varying compositions of Aluminum, Manganese and Silicon on the x,y and z axis respectively. The temperatures were obtained through a computational thermodynamics simulation done on the Thermo Calc software's property models.
